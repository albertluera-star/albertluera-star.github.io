## Quick Setup Commands (Mac/Linux)

Run these commands in your Terminal from the root of your website folder:

```bash
cd assets/projects

mkdir 510-day big-fun bussdown concert-visuals in-a-dream king-most makeroom misc-art nightlife-residencies nvrovr perra-xl radbird-llc secret-menu slap-city somar tpne y2k-throwbacks
```

## File Naming Guide

Each folder needs a `cover.webp` file. This is the main image that will display on your website.

**Image specifications:**
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Size: 1200x900px minimum (4:3 ratio works best)
- File size: Under 500KB for web performance
- Name: Must be exactly `cover.webp` (lowercase)

## Adding Your Images

1. Export/save your project images as JPG
2. Resize them to 1200x900px (or similar 4:3 ratio)
3. Rename each to `cover.webp`
4. Place in the corresponding project folder

## Projects Featured on Home Page

These 6 projects appear on the home page:
1. TPNE (The Party Never Ends)
2. Slap City Residency
3. Radbird LLC Branding
4. NVROVR
5. 510 Day
6. Y2K Throwbacks

Make sure these have especially strong cover images!

## Optional: Add More Images to Each Project

You can add more images to each folder for future expansion:

```
assets/projects/tpne/
├── cover.webp       ← Main image (required)
├── image1.webp      ← Additional images (optional)
├── image2.webp
└── image3.webp
```

## Need Help?

If you're unsure about which image to use as a cover, choose:
- Your most eye-catching design from that project
- An image with strong composition
- Something that represents the project's vibe
- High contrast/bold visuals work best with the halftone effect
